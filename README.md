# ARGUS OIDC client 

Argus OIDC client is a daemon that has the responsibility of checking validity
and signatures of OAuth tokens for registered trusted OAuth authorization
servers.

The daemon exposes an OAuth token introspection endpoint compliant with [RFC
7662][rfc7662] that can be used by authenticated clients to inspect tokens. The
daemon can only introspect JWT access tokens that contain the `iss` claim.

## How it works

The OIDC client is registered as a client at one (or more) trusted OAuth
authorization servers, and is used by client applications as a gateway for
token validation and introspection.

OIDC performs local JWT validation checks and leverage the introspection
endpoints at trusted AS to inspect a submitted token. The result of a token
introspection is cached, if oidc-client caching is enabled.

## Configuration

Argus OIDC client listens by default on port 8156 and binds on 127.0.0.1. With
this configuration the oidc client will answer token introspection at this
plain http endpoint:

```
http://127.0.0.1/argus-oidc-client/introspect
```

To change the port and address, use the `CLIENT_PORT` and `CLIENT_ADDRESS` env
variables. 

By default oidc client requires client authentication. The default credentials
that client should provide when introspecting a token are:

- username: 'user'
- password: 'password'

These defaults can be changed by setting the `CLIENT_USER_NAME` and
`CLIENT_USER_PASSWORD` env variables. Basic authentication can be disabled by
setting the `CLIENT_ENABLE_BASIC_AUTH` env variables to `false`.

The oidc client should be deployed behind a reverse proxy used to terminate
TLS. When deploying behind a reverse proxy, set the
`CLIENT_USE_FORWARDED_HEADERS` env variable to true.

#### Authorization server configuration

Trusted authorization servers can be configured via a provided `application.yml`
file with the following structure:

```yaml
oidc:
  clients:
      - issuer-url: https://iam.example
        client-id: iam.example.client-id
        client-secret: iam.example.client-secret
      - issuer-url: https://iam2.example
        client-id: iam2.example.client-id
        client-secret: iam2.example.client-secret

```

See instructions below on how this file can be provided when running the
service with Docker.

#### Cache management

Argus OIDC client uses an internal in-memory cache to cache results of token
introspection and userinfo calls. 

The size and the eviction time for the cache can be set using the
`CLIENT_CACHE_SPEC` environment variable. 

By default, the cache is setup with a maximum size of 500 elements and the
records are evicted after 60 seconds, as follows:

```bash
CLIENT_CACHE_SPEC=maximumSize=500,expireAfterWrite=60s
```
More configuration options can be found into [caffeine official
documentation](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine/wiki).

The cache can be disabled by setting the `CLIENT_CACHE` environment variable as
follows:

```
CLIENT_CACHE=none
```

### Configuration reference

```bash
# oidc client will bind on this port
CLIENT_PORT=8156

# oidc client will bind on this address
CLIENT_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1

# Set this to true when deploying behind a reverse proxy (nginx)
CLIENT_USE_FORWARDED_HEADERS=false

# X.509 trust anchors location
X509_TRUST_ANCHORS_DIR=/etc/grid-security/certificates/

# X.509 trust anchors refresh interval (in msec)
X509_TRUST_ANCHORS_REFRESH=14400

# Enable basic authentication
CLIENT_ENABLE_BASIC_AUTH=true

# User name credential requested from clients introspecting tokens
CLIENT_USER_NAME=user

# Password  credential requested from clients introspecting tokens
CLIENT_USER_PASSWORD=password

# Enables caching of the results of introspection and userinfo calls 
# To disable the cache set CLIENT_CACHE=none
CLIENT_CACHE=caffeine

# The size and eviction time policies for the cache
CLIENT_CACHE_SPEC=maximumSize=500,expireAfterWrite=60s

# TLS version
CLIENT_TLS_VERSION=TLSv1.2
```

## Running the service

### Docker

1. Define the endpoints and credentials for trusted authorization servers in
   an application.yml file as explained above

2. Define an env file containing the configuration for the oidc-client
   instance following the instructions above

3. Run the service with a command like this:
  ```console
  docker run --env-file=oidc-client.env -v application.yml:/argus-oidc-client/config/application.yml:ro argus-oidc-client:latest
  ```
